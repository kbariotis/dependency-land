## Development

This project contains a simple client website and a small server with a REST API. Once deployed it runs the server and a background service that keeps the local data set up-to-date continously.

The client is based on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), it talks to the API and renders the results. The server is a [hapi](https://hapijs.com/) server with a couple of plugins. It wraps the functionality of [npm-dependency-db](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-dependency-db) and [dependency-db](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dependency-db).

1. Install server dependencies and client dependencies.

		npm install && cd client && npm install && cd ..

2. Start both the server and the client in development mode.

		npm start
